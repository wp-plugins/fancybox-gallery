Integrates the FancyBox jQuery plugin to generate dynamic pop-up image
overlays for WordPress galleries.

== Description ==

Features:
* Automatically scales large images to fit in window
* Adds a nice drop shadow under the zoomed item

FancyBox jQuery features, not yet implemented in the WordPress plugin:
* Groups related items and adds navigation through them (uses preloading)
* Can display images, inline and iframed content
* Customizable through settings and CSS


== Installation ==

Copy the fancybox-gallery folder and its contents to your wp-content/plugins
directory, then activate the plugin.

Visit the settings page to configure options.

By default, FancyBox Gallery is configured to work with image galleries
generated by the WordPress [gallery link="file"] shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with other media, like videos? =

Yes, FancyBox Gallery can work with other embedded media types.

== Changelog ==

2009-01-25 ver 0.1
    Initial release. No options, yet. Only works if you use the 
    gallery shortcode like so: `[gallery link="file"]`

== ToDo ==

* Add a settings screen. Allow control of FancyBox display options.
* Let user set their own CSS selector, instead of assuming the standard
  WordPress shortcode.
* Test against more themes for visual layout problems.
* ?? Filter gallery output to add `rel` attribute, so that images
  can be grouped.
